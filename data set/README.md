Dataset

We are sharing the dataset for further development and research. The dataset has ANSYS simulation values of u, v, p for R_e = 10 to R_e = 1000 for lid driven cavity across 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 mesh resolutions.

They are stored as follows

{mesh size}/{mesh size}_{parameter}_{lid velocity}.txt

where 
mesh size is {8, 16, 32, 64}
parameter is {u, v, pressure}
lid velocity is {0.01, 0.02, 0.03....1.00}
